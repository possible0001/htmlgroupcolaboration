    <h1>About Myself</h1>


    <p>
        My name is Abdulbaset Onaolapo. I am 18 years old and I live in Ibadan, Nigeria. I am a 
        calm and focused person who believes that small daily efforts can make a big difference in my future.
    </p>


    <p>
        I grew up in a family that values honesty and respect. These values guide me every day. 
        In school, I enjoy learning and I always try to improve, even when a subject is difficult.
    </p>


    <p>
        I love football, watching great freeâ€‘kick takers, and practicing my skills. I also like computers. 
        I am learning the basics of HTML so I can create simple web pages like this one.

    <p>
        My goals are to keep building my knowledge, do well in my exams, and use my skills 
        to help people around me. I believe in hard work, kindness, and staying true to myself.
